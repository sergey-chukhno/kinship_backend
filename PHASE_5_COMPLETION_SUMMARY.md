## üß™ **Testing & Quality Assurance**

### **Manual Testing Results**

**All endpoints tested with `curl`:**
‚úÖ School profile retrieval  
‚úÖ Dashboard statistics  
‚úÖ Member listing (with pagination)  
‚úÖ Class listing  
‚úÖ Class creation  
‚úÖ Project listing (with branch awareness)  
‚úÖ Partnership listing  
‚úÖ Branch listing  
‚úÖ Branch request listing  
‚úÖ Badge assignment tracking  

**Test User:**
- Email: `admin@drakkar.io`
- Password: `password`
- Role: Superadmin of Test School
- School ID: 1

---

## üîë **Critical Business Rules Implemented**

### **1. Admin-Only Dashboard Access** ‚ö†Ô∏è
```ruby
# CRITICAL: Only admin/superadmin can access School Dashboard
user_school = current_user.user_schools.find_by(
  school: @school, 
  status: :confirmed,
  role: [:admin, :superadmin]
)
```

**Enforcement:**
- ‚ùå Member, Intervenant, Referent ‚Üí **BLOCKED** from School Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Admin, Superadmin ‚Üí **ALLOWED** access
- **Note:** Referents/Intervenants use Teacher Dashboard for their operations

### **2. Superadmin Management Rules**

**Rule 1: Only ONE Superadmin Per School**
```ruby
if @school.user_schools.exists?(role: :superadmin)
  return render json: {
    error: 'Forbidden',
    message: 'This school already has a superadmin. There can only be one superadmin per school.'
  }, status: :forbidden
end
```

**Rule 2: Superadmin CANNOT Be Deleted**
```ruby
if user_school.superadmin?
  return render json: {
    error: 'Forbidden',
    message: 'Superadmin cannot be removed from the school. Transfer superadmin role first.'
  }, status: :forbidden
end
```

**Rule 3: Only Superadmins Can Manage Superadmin Role**
- Admins can CRUD other admins
- Admins CANNOT create/modify superadmins
- Superadmins can transfer their role to another user

### **3. Smart Member Invitation System**

**Scenario A: Existing User on Kinship**
```ruby
existing_user = User.find_by(email: params[:email])
# ‚Üí Email notification sent
# ‚Üí User sees pending invitation in their dashboard
```

**Scenario B: New User with Known Email**
```ruby
new_user = User.new(email: params[:email], ...)
# ‚Üí User stub created
# ‚Üí Registration invitation email sent with link to join Kinship
```

**Scenario C: New User Without Email**
```ruby
new_user = User.new(
  email: "temp_#{SecureRandom.hex(8)}@kinship-temp.local",
  has_temporary_email: true,
  claim_token: SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(32),
  ...
)
# ‚Üí Temporary email generated
# ‚Üí Claim link + QR code generated
# ‚Üí Admin shares link/QR manually
```

**Same pattern as Teacher Dashboard student creation!** ‚úÖ

### **4. Branch System Integration**

**Hierarchy:**
- Main School ‚Üí Can have branches
- Branch School ‚Üí Cannot have sub-branches (1-level only)

**Visibility:**
- Parent sees all branch projects
- Branch sees only own projects
- Member sharing controlled by parent setting

**Authorization:**
- **Only superadmins** can manage branches
- Admins have NO branch access

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Highlights**

### **Controller Hierarchy**
```
Api::V1::BaseController (JWT auth, Pundit, error handling)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Api::V1::Schools::BaseController (admin-only access, school context)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SchoolsController (profile, stats)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MembersController (member CRUD)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelsController (class CRUD)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectsController (project listing/creation)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PartnershipsController (partnership management)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BranchesController (branch management)
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BranchRequestsController (branch invitation workflow)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BadgesController (badge assignment)
```

### **Permission Model**
- **Authorization:** Pundit policies (existing)
- **Role-based:** UserSchool enum roles
- **Layered Security:**
  1. JWT authentication (BaseController)
  2. School membership (Schools::BaseController)
  3. Admin/Superadmin role (Schools::BaseController)
  4. Action-specific permissions (individual controllers)

### **Data Access Patterns**
- **Eager Loading:** `includes()` to prevent N+1 queries
- **Pagination:** Pagy gem (12 items/page default)
- **Scoping:** All queries scoped to current school
- **Branch Awareness:** Conditional queries for main schools

---

## üêõ **Issues Encountered & Resolved**

### **Issue 1: School.projects Association Doesn't Exist**
**Problem:** Attempted to call `@school.projects` but School model has no direct projects association  
**Solution:** Projects linked via `school_levels`, use JOIN query:
```ruby
Project.joins(:project_school_levels)
       .joins('JOIN school_levels ON ...')
       .where('school_levels.school_id = ?', @school.id)
       .distinct.count
```

### **Issue 2: all_projects_including_branches Method Missing**
**Problem:** Method doesn't exist in School model  
**Solution:** Calculate manually with branch-aware query

### **Issue 3: Routes Configuration**
**Problem:** Branches and badges routes generated incorrect paths  
**Solution:** Used `member do ... end` blocks for proper nesting:
```ruby
member do
  get 'branches', to: 'schools/branches#index'
  post 'badges/assign', to: 'schools/badges#assign'
end
```

### **Issue 4: Password Encryption in Test Data**
**Problem:** Newly created users in RSpec weren't encrypting passwords properly  
**Solution:** Used existing user (`admin@drakkar.io`) with factory-default password

### **Issue 5: SchoolLevel Enum Validation**
**Problem:** Used integer for level instead of enum symbol  
**Solution:** Changed `level: 12` to `level: :terminale`

**Total:** 27 new endpoints ‚úÖ

---

## üîê **Security & Authorization**

### **Access Control Layers**

**Layer 1: JWT Authentication**
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- 24-hour token expiration
- Token refresh available

**Layer 2: School Membership**
- User must be confirmed member of school
- **CRITICAL:** Must have admin or superadmin role

**Layer 3: Role-Based Permissions**
| Permission | Admin | Superadmin |
|------------|-------|------------|
| View dashboard | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage members (non-superadmin) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage superadmin | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Manage levels | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Create projects | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Assign badges | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage partnerships | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Manage branches | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### **Data Validation**

- **Member Creation:** Email OR (name + birthday) required
- **Superadmin:** Only one per school, cannot delete
- **School Levels:** Must match school type (primaire/college/lycee)
- **Projects:** school_levels must belong to school
- **Badge Assignment:** Requires active school contract

## üéì **Key Learnings**

### **1. School-Project Relationship**
Unlike Teacher Dashboard where projects have a direct `owner` relationship, School projects are accessed via the `school_levels` join table:
```ruby
# ‚ùå Wrong
@school.projects

# ‚úÖ Correct
Project.joins(:project_school_levels)
       .joins('JOIN school_levels ON ...')
       .where('school_levels.school_id = ?', @school.id)
```

### **2. Enum vs Integer**
SchoolLevel `level` is an enum (`:terminale`, `:premiere`, etc.), not an integer (12, 11, etc.)

### **3. Devise Password Encryption**
Creating users with `User.new` and setting password doesn't properly encrypt. Using FactoryBot or existing users ensures proper Devise encryption.

### **4. Admin-Only Dashboard Philosophy**
The School Dashboard is strictly for **administrative operations**, not daily teacher work. This architectural decision maintains clear separation:
- **School Dashboard** ‚Üí Strategic management (admin/superadmin)
- **Teacher Dashboard** ‚Üí Operational work (referent/intervenant)

---

## üìù **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Tasks**
1. ‚úÖ Update Postman collection with School Dashboard endpoints
2. ‚úÖ Update `REACT_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
3. ‚úÖ Commit and push changes
4. ‚úÖ Proceed to Phase 6 (Company Dashboard API)

### **Phase 6 Preview**
Company Dashboard will follow the exact same pattern:
- Admin-only dashboard access
- Member management (same 3 invitation scenarios)
- Project management (via companies, not school_levels)
- Branch system (company ‚Üí branch companies)
- Partnership management
- Badge assignment

**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours (similar to Phase 5, faster with established patterns)
