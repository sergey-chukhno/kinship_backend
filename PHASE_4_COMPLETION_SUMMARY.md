# Phase 4: Teacher Dashboard API - Completion Summary

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

Successfully implemented and tested the complete Teacher Dashboard API with comprehensive functionality for managing classes, students, projects, and badge assignments.

---

## ✅ **What We Completed**

### **1. API Foundation (Phases 1-3)**
- **JWT Authentication** - Stateless authentication with 24-hour token expiration
- **CORS Configuration** - Flexible CORS for localhost development
- **Core Serializers** - 2-level depth with full includes by default
- **User Dashboard API** - Complete user profile and project management
- **Badge Assignment System** - Multi-organization badge assignment with contracts

### **2. Teacher Dashboard API (Phase 4)**
- **Teacher Stats** - Overview of classes, students, projects, and badge assignments
- **School Management** - List schools where teacher has roles
- **Class Management** - CRUD operations for school and independent classes
- **Student Management** - Create students with optional email system
- **Project Management** - Full CRUD with member management
- **Badge Attribution Tracking** - View all badges assigned by teacher

### **3. Advanced Features Implemented**
